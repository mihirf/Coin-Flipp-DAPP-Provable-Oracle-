# Coin-Flipp-DAPP-Provable-Oracle-
Coin Flipp is a decentralized application where the player can bet Ether by selecting a coin side (either heads or tails). If the player wins, they can claim double the amount of Ether placed as a bet. However, if they lose, their deposit remains in the contract.   This DAPP utilizes the Provable Oracle for achieving randomness. It has been tested on the Ropsten Test Network without any issues. 

# Testing
The truffle framework used for testing the functionalities of the DAPP. To install the truffle framework, the follow command was used "npm i -g truffle@nodeLTS".
